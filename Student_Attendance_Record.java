/*551. Student Attendance Record I

You are given a string s representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

'A': Absent.
'L': Late.
'P': Present.
The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:

The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.
Return true if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or false otherwise.*/
